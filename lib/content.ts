      <p>According to the God who created the universe and all humanity, humans are a unique kind of creation. He has explicitly stated that murder is evil at any age. He Himself took on human flesh and was knit together in His mother's womb from conception (Psalm 139:13-16, Luke 1:31).</p>
      <p>Scientific consensus affirms this:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>At fertilization, a new, genetically distinct human organism comes into existence</li>
        <li>This organism has its own unique DNA, separate from both mother and father</li>
        <li>From this moment, the human being begins a continuous process of development</li>

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Every human being is a "clump of cells." This description applies equally to adults.</li>
        <li>The unborn child has unique human DNA from the moment of conception.</li>
        <li>The unborn child has a heartbeat as early as 6 weeks.</li>
        <li>The unborn child can feel pain and responds to stimuli.</li>

      <p>Response:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The child in the womb is not the mother's body. It has its own unique DNA, often a different blood type, and may be a different sex.</li>
        <li>Bodily autonomy does not extend to harming another person. You cannot use your body to assault or kill another human being.</li>
        <li>The right to bodily autonomy is not absolute. We accept many limitations on it for the good of society (vaccine mandates, drug laws, etc.).</li>

        <li>Rape is a horrific crime deserving severe punishment. We have deep compassion for rape victims.</li>
        <li>However, the child conceived in rape is innocent. Why should an innocent child receive the death penalty for the crime of his father?</li>
        <li>Two wrongs don't make a right. Adding violence (abortion) to violence (rape) does not bring healing.</li>
        <li>Many women who have abortions after rape report additional trauma, not healing.</li>

      <p>Response:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Legitimate medical interventions to save the mother's life are not the same as elective abortion.</li>
        <li>When a doctor performs a procedure to save the mother and the child dies as an unintended consequence, this is not murder.</li>
        <li>Directly killing the child is never medically necessary. Treatment of the mother may result in the child's death, but the death is not the goal.</li>
        <li>Modern medicine has advanced to the point where these situations are extremely rare.</li>

        <li>Where does your law that religious beliefs shouldn't influence legislation come from? That itself is a religious or philosophical claim.</li>
        <li>All law is based on moral values. The question is: whose morality?</li>
        <li>The pro-choice position is also a moral position. It makes claims about personhood, rights, and value.</li>
        <li>We don't need religious arguments to oppose abortion. Science and reason support the pro-life position.</li>

        <li>This argument would also silence pro-choice men. Do you really want to do that?</li>
        <li>Many women are pro-life. In fact, women are roughly split on the issue.</li>
        <li>Truth is not determined by the identity of the speaker. An argument is valid or invalid regardless of who makes it.</li>
        <li>By this logic, we couldn't oppose slavery unless we were slaves, or oppose child abuse unless we were children.</li>

        <li>The solution to poverty is not to kill poor people but to help them.</li>

        <li>Abortion kills a child every time. We cannot legalize murder to make it "safer" for the murderer.</li>
        <li>Making abortion illegal does reduce abortion rates, as we've seen in many states and countries.</li>

        <li>This argument could apply to any age. "Should every infant death be investigated?" In cases of suspected abuse, yes. In cases of natural illness, no.</li>

        <li>Incremental bills concede that some babies can be legally killed.</li>

      <p>Response:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>There is a fundamental difference between innocent life and guilty life.</li>
        <li>The unborn child is completely innocent. A convicted murderer has forfeited his right to life by taking another's.</li>
        <li>Scripture distinguishes between murder (prohibited) and lawful execution (permitted in some circumstances).</li>
        <li>Protecting innocent life and punishing guilty murderers are consistent positions.</li>
