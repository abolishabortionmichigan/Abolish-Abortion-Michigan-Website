              At the heart of our mission is not just a political cause, but the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe that true and lasting change comes only through the transformation of hearts by God&apos;s grace.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Problem: Sin</h3>
            <p>
              The Bible teaches that all people have sinned and fallen short of God&apos;s glory (Romans 3:23). Sin is not just doing bad things—it is rebellion against God, our Creator. We have all broken God&apos;s law, and the penalty for sin is death and eternal separation from God (Romans 6:23).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Solution: Jesus Christ</h3>
            <p>
              God, in His great love, sent His Son Jesus Christ to save us. Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. He died on the cross, taking the punishment that we deserved. On the third day, He rose from the dead, defeating sin and death forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through His death and resurrection, Jesus made a way for us to be forgiven and reconciled to God. This is the good news—the Gospel.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Response: Faith and Repentance</h3>
            <p>
              God calls us to respond to the Gospel with repentance and faith. Repentance means turning away from sin and turning to God. Faith means trusting in Jesus Christ alone for salvation—not our own good works or efforts.

            <p>
              Salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. Here is what the Bible says about how to be saved:

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-2">1. Acknowledge Your Sin</h3>
                <p>
                  Recognize that you have sinned against God and cannot save yourself. &ldquo;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&rdquo; (Romans 3:23).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Trust that Jesus died for your sins and rose again. &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved&rdquo; (Acts 16:31).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Turn away from sin and turn to God. &ldquo;Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out&rdquo; (Acts 3:19).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Publicly acknowledge Jesus as your Lord and Savior. &ldquo;If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved&rdquo; (Romans 10:9).

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">A Word to Those Who Have Had Abortions</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you have been involved in abortion—whether as the mother, father, doctor, or in any other capacity—know this: <span className="text-red-500 font-semibold">there is forgiveness in Jesus Christ.</span>
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The same Gospel that calls abortion murder also offers complete forgiveness for all who repent and believe. No sin is too great for God&apos;s grace. Through faith in Christ, you can be washed clean and made new.
              </p>
              <p>
                &ldquo;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo; (1 John 1:9).
