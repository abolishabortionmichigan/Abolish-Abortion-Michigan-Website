            <p>
              Yes, we believe that the going forth of the good news of Jesus Christ as King is the answer to abortion and the key to abolition.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are many people who understand on an intellectual and scientific level that the preborn are humans worthy of protection, and because of that understanding hold a pro-life position right up until they find themselves in a difficult or painful situation, or with a need to cover up sin. Just like there are many people who are opposed to adultery or divorce until their own marriage gets hard enough or painful enough or they meet someone wonderful enough, and suddenly their personal circumstances justify what they once opposed (or in some cases still oppose).
            </p>

            <p>
              This is why we say not only that abortion is sin, but that the Gospel is the answer to sin. It&apos;s easy to give mental and intellectual assent to an idea you know is correct, but without the transforming power of Jesus Christ, without the grace of God to resist sin and a regenerate heart, your moral compass is at the mercy of your circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
              The work of abolition is not just about saving babies. It&apos;s taking part in the battle that rages for the souls of men, women, and children, and fighting for righteousness in every arena. Abolitionism is not about a cause, but about serving a King. And Jesus Christ, the King of all, is the answer to not only abortion, but to all the painful, broken, wickedness of the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              As Christian Abolitionists we believe that we are called to go out into the whole world calling every man and every nation to repent and follow Jesus Christ as Lord. This is in contrast to pro-lifers who believe that the call to repentance and gospel of Christ&apos;s Kingdom is to be preached and applied to individuals alone.
            </p>

            <p>
              For instance, the protestant-led ecumenical pro-life think tank and training seminar provider &ldquo;Life Training Institute&rdquo; sums up the pro-life movement&apos;s views on the applicability of the gospel to abortion ministry in saying, &ldquo;We are called to personal holiness; our nation is not called to be subservient to God. It&apos;s significant that Jesus came to preach personal holiness, not to reform Roman society. In fact, they said &lsquo;render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&apos;s, and to God the things that are God&apos;s&rsquo; (Matthew 22:21, NASB). The Gospel is the antidote to sin in a believer&apos;s life; it is not the key to reformation of society. For that, we must work through the political process.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
              <p className="font-bold text-lg">We disagree.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              We believe that nations that practice and protect child sacrifice will be judged by the Living God. We do believe that they can turn to Christ and honor Him as King. We do believe that the Gospel of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ is the key to reforming society. The GOSPEL is THE ANSWER to all sin, individual and national! And we have been commissioned to bring that Gospel into every nation of the world and to announce the triumph of Jesus Christ over sin and death and the coming of the Kingdom of God as we call all men everywhere to repent!
            </p>

            <p>
              This belief in national repentance and the power of the Gospel to remove evils has been central to abolitionism for the past 300 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              We understand that a majority of the people in our nation believe that choosing to believe the Gospel is just a personal private matter and never think twice about what the Gospel has to do with the Nations of this fallen world, and we are fully aware that the Word of God states very clearly that those who embrace worldly wisdom over and above the principles and plan of God will call the Gospel foolish, but to see these views promoted by professing apologists of the Christian faith is deeply troubling. Its not that men like Clinton Wilcox (writer of the statement referenced above) reject the gospel or disbelieve in the Gospel, they just choose to put the Gospel of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ on the back-burner when it comes to grave national evils like child sacrifice because they think it is powerless to affect moral transformation, cultural renewal, revival, or national repentance.

                When someone tells me, &lsquo;Yes, we need to have a high view of God and we need to preach the gospel this way&mdash;just like you said, it&apos;s biblical&mdash;but&hellip; that just won&apos;t work.&rsquo; What you need to realize is that it never would &lsquo;work!&rsquo; That is the mystery of the gospel! It is something that won&apos;t work&mdash;except that God has ordained it, and the Spirit of God is behind it!

                Our trust for victory is solely in God. While we may be personally defeated and beaten down, our principles will never be, for they rest upon God&apos;s infallible Word. Truth, Justice, Reason, and Humanity must &ndash; and will &ndash; gloriously triumph over the evil of our age. &hellip;Under the guidance and by the help of Almighty God, we will do all that lies within us to abolish human abortion, to deliver our nation from its deadliest curse, and to secure to the pre-born all the rights and privileges that belong to them as image-bearers of God. By the blood of the lamb and the word of our witness, by the power of the Holy Spirit, in His Providence and in accordance with his plan, we shall crush the dragon abortion beneath our feet (Rev. 12:1, Rom. 16:20). In the name and power of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and maker of man, who Himself became a human embryo within the womb of a young, unmarried, woman who had not chosen to be &ldquo;with child&rdquo; (Matt. 1:18), &ndash; we will destroy this work of darkness and effect the total abolition of human abortion. For to Christ belongs all authority in Heaven and on Earth. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His Kingdom one that shall not be destroyed (Matt. 28:18; Dan. 7:14). Of the increase of His government and of peace, there shall be no end (Is. 9:7).

              The pro-life establishment may choose to believe that the people of God must compromise with national evils and that the Gospel is powerless when it comes to seeking justice and showing mercy in a nation at large, but we have read the Word of God and we know that the Gospel is not just about individuals but nations, and the destruction of every work of darkness. We know and are witness to the ways in which Jesus Christ is making all things new. We are His ambassadors. We are members of His helpmate bride. If we choose to shelve His Gospel when it comes to national sins and the practice of Child Sacrifice, can we really claim to know or believe in Him?
            </p>

            <p>
              The movement to abolish human abortion is born of God and will be part of Christ&apos;s victorious triumph in the world. For we truly believe that Jesus is the Son of God; that He has set us free; that He has conquered death; that he is making all things new and that the victory is already won!
            </p>

            <p>
              By the blood of the lamb and the word of our witness, we are overcoming the world and its darkness. We are not waiting on the rapture or holding pessimistic training seminars while the world goes to hell in a hand-basket. We are going to war!
            </p>

            <p>
              We are not those who shrink back or console one another other with worldly theologies that state there is no promise of success or possibility of abolition. We know that sin and death will remain until the full blown return of our King, but we can and will establish justice for the fatherless in our lands and bring them under the protection of our laws. We will criminalize child sacrifice and put an end to the legal protection and practice of all destructive and dehumanizing practices being cried out against the littlest and least of our neighbors and fellow image bearers. We have plows in our hands, seeds to cast all around us, and we will work as long as the day last.
            </p>

            <p>
              We strive toward our goal in the knowledge that we follow a mighty King!

            <p>
              The helpmate bride of Christ is rising up and every day our enemies expose themselves to the growing light. While many still appear to the masses as angels of light seeking to mislead and discourage the saints, they will not get very far. There is a remnant of true believers in this land and we have the Word of God and the Holy Spirit to guide us.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Son of God has gone to war! He leads His people to the gates of the dragon&apos;s lairs and fortifies them as they tear down the speculations and high places which protect them and call out the dim-light buildings in the valleys bellow them who tolerate their constant demonic slaughter.
            </p>

            <p>
              All around us there are people telling those who would take up the battle cry &ldquo;Abolish Human Abortion!&rdquo; to settle down, get the best that they can get, and to just doing what they have been doing for the past 40 years. Yet our numbers are ever growing and even the losses we incur as a result of these meddling and divisive spirits only strengthen our fellowship and resolve.
            </p>

            <p>
              On behalf of the weak, and in the name of Jesus Christ, we will overcome.
            </p>

                The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
