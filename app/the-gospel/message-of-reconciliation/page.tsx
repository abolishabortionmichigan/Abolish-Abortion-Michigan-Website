              Abolitionists aim to transform this wicked culture and society, by the grace of God, with the Gospel of Jesus the Messiah and His holy law. To all those who repent of the wickedness of their heart, thoughts, and actions, and who put their trust solely in Jesus, the Gospel offers forgiveness, eternal life, and freedom from sin. The Lord Jesus, who chose to leave the glory of Heaven, who came to Earth as an embryo, who grew up clothed in human flesh, who taught truth, love, and grace, who died on the cross at the hands of evil men, and who rose victoriously from the dead on the third day as He had predicted, is the focus of the abolitionist&apos;s life and work. It is out of love for Him that we obey his command to love our neighbor as ourselves.
