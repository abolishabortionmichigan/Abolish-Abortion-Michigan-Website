          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Our Identity</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">
            Abolish Abortion Michigan is a coalition of Christians who believe that abortion is murder and must be abolished immediately—not regulated, not reduced, but completely ended.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We are not a political organization, though we engage in political action. We are not primarily activists, though we take action. We are first and foremost followers of Jesus Christ who believe that loving our neighbors means defending the most vulnerable among us—the preborn.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
            We work alongside churches, pastors, and Christians throughout the state of Michigan to call for the immediate abolition of abortion through bills of abolition that would treat abortion as the crime that it is.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Our Approach</h2>
          <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-red-600">Gospel-Centered</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                We believe that true change comes through the transformation of hearts by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. While we work for legal abolition, we also share the good news that there is forgiveness for all sins—including abortion—through faith in Christ.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-red-600">Church-Focused</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                We believe the Church must lead the way in calling for justice. We work to equip churches and pastors with resources and encouragement to speak out boldly for the preborn.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-red-600">Abolition, Not Regulation</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                We do not support incremental measures that regulate abortion while leaving it legal. We call for the immediate and total abolition of abortion as murder, with no exceptions.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-red-600">Peaceful & Lawful</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                We are committed to peaceful, legal means of advocacy. We condemn all violence and seek to change hearts and laws through persuasion, education, and the political process.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Unlike traditional pro-life organizations that have spent 50 years trying to regulate abortion, we call for its immediate abolition. We believe that:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <li>Abortion is murder and should be treated as such under the law</li>
            <li>There should be no exceptions—not for rape, incest, or any other circumstance</li>
            <li>Incremental bills that permit some abortions are unjust and should be opposed</li>
            <li>States have the authority and obligation to protect all human life regardless of federal rulings</li>
            <li>The Church must be the conscience of the nation and call for equal justice for all</li>
          </ul>
