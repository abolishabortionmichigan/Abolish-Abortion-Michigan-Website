              <p>
                We believe the Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and authoritative Word of God. It is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice.

              <p>
                We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is the Creator, Sustainer, and Ruler of all things.

                We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His atoning death, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.

                We believe salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. It is a gift from God, not a result of human works.

          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              <span className="text-red-600 font-semibold">We believe abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human being</span> and is therefore murder, a grave sin against God and humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe human life begins at conception, when a new human being with unique DNA comes into existence. From that moment, every human being bears the image of God and has inherent dignity and worth.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe there are no circumstances that justify the intentional killing of an innocent human being. This includes cases of rape, incest, disability, or any other circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe those who have participated in abortion—whether as the mother, father, doctor, or in any other capacity—can find forgiveness through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.

              <span className="text-red-600 font-semibold">We believe abortion must be abolished immediately and totally</span>, not merely regulated or reduced.
            </p>
            <p>
              We oppose incremental legislation that permits some abortions to continue. Such legislation treats some children as less worthy of protection than others and perpetuates the lie that some abortions are acceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe states have the authority and obligation to protect all human life within their borders, regardless of federal rulings to the contrary. When federal law conflicts with the law of God, states must obey God rather than men.
            </p>
            <p>
              We call for bills of abolition that would:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Define abortion as the intentional killing of a preborn human being</li>
              <li>Criminalize abortion as murder, with no exceptions</li>
              <li>Provide equal protection under the law for all human beings from conception</li>
              <li>Nullify any federal law, regulation, or court opinion that permits abortion</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We are committed to peaceful, legal means of achieving abolition. We condemn all violence and work to change hearts and laws through persuasion, education, and political action.
