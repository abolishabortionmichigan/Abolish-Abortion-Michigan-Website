            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Our Position on Violence</h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">Abolish Abortion Michigan unequivocally condemns all violence against any person, including those who perform or procure abortions.</span>
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We believe that human life is sacred from conception to natural death. This conviction applies to all human beings—including abortionists, abortion clinic workers, and all others involved in the abortion industry. They, too, bear the image of God and are loved by Him.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">We Affirm:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Violence is wrong.</strong> We oppose the use of violence, threats of violence, intimidation, or any illegal activity in pursuit of our goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Violence is counterproductive.</strong> Acts of violence harm our cause and bring disrepute to the name of Christ.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We follow Christ&apos;s example.</strong> Jesus taught us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us (Matthew 5:44).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We trust in God&apos;s means.</strong> We believe in the power of prayer, the preaching of the Gospel, and peaceful, lawful advocacy to change hearts and laws.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>We seek conversion, not destruction.</strong> Our goal is to see abortionists and their supporters come to repentance and faith in Christ.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">We Reject:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">

                We pursue the abolition of abortion through exclusively peaceful and legal means:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li>Prayer for the end of abortion and the conversion of those involved</li>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">A Word to Those Considering Violence</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              If you are considering any act of violence in the name of opposing abortion, we urge you in the strongest possible terms: <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">Do not do it.</span>
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Violence against persons is murder. It is sin against God. It will not save a single child. It will only bring harm to yourself, to others, and to the cause of abolition.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Instead, we call you to trust in God, to use the means He has appointed, and to leave vengeance to Him (Romans 12:19).
            </p>

              <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1a1a1a]">
                &ldquo;Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, &apos;Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.&apos;&rdquo;
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">— Romans 12:19</p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We are committed to pursuing justice for the preborn through means that honor God and respect the dignity of all human beings. We invite you to join us in this commitment.
