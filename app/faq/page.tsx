            Abortion is the murder, the sacrifice, of tiny neighbors who have not yet been born.{' '}

            Below are common pro-choice objections that we have run across. If you are opposed to the abolition of human abortion, find your pet issue below and deal with the arguments against it.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Be forewarned – rare is the pro-choicer who ever advances the argument beyond the following series of steps:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
            <li>The pro-choicer offers one of the objections refuted below.</li>
            <li>An abolitionist rebuts the objection, usually with one of the arguments below its respective objection.</li>
            <li>
              The pro-choicer either:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>moves to an entirely different objection, and/or</li>
                <li>responds with a complete misunderstanding of the offered rebuttal, and/or</li>
                <li>dismisses the rebuttal, and/or</li>
                <li>engages in profane/obscene/outraged discourse in order to intimidate the abolitionist.</li>
              </ul>

            Don&apos;t be like that. This is a serious issue, and these are serious rebuttals. We dare you to advance the debate, as we have already done. Set yourself apart from the vast majority of people.
